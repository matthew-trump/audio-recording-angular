<h2>Record RTC with File Upload</h2>

<p class="description">
  This demo of how to use <a href="https://github.com/muaz-khan/RecordRTC">Record RTC</a>
  to record and save the audio stream as a WAV file. The upload demo as configured here requires
  the <a href="https://github.com/matthew-trump/audio-recording-node-express">Audio Recording Node Express</a>
  server, which is a companion to this project. By default the app attempt to upload to this server at
  localhost:8080.

<div class="audio-panel">

  <p class="directions">Click to the microphone icon to record. The stream will
    automatically detect when you are finished speaking. The WAV file is then uploaded
    and if successful, audio control will appear to play the uploaded file from the server.
